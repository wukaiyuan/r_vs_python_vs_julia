# R vs. Python: head to head data analysis â€“ Julia addendum
Inspired by this excellent blog post by Vik of Dataquest.io fame:
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-vs-r/

## Usage
You can view this notebook within Github or download and open using the IJulia package while running Julia:
using IJulia
notebook()
